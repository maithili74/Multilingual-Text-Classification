# Multilingual-Text-Classification

Project Overview

This project focuses on building a toxic comment classification model using a combination of traditional machine learning models and deep learning models. The objective is to predict whether a given comment is toxic or not. We leveraged Word2Vec embeddings for feature extraction and applied various classification models to achieve the highest accuracy.
